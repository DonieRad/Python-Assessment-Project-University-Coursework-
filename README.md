# Python-Assessment-Project-University-Coursework-
This repository contains my solutions for the **Programming and Algorithms (DAM101)** assessment. The tasks cover Python fundamentals such as loops, sets, file handling, and user input validation.  

I’ve included both the **assessment brief** and my completed solutions in **Python scripts**. Also a **task3** → requires numbers2.txt in scripts/ folder.

## Tasks Covered
1. **Filtering Numbers**  
   - Function that filters numbers > 5 using a list comprehension and while loop.

2. **Sets and Operations**  
   - Collect user input into a set.  
   - Compare sets (intersection & union).  
   - Print set values in descending order.  

3. **File Handling & Math**  
   - Read numbers from a file.  
   - Calculate the average.  
   - Find the smallest even number.  

4. **Basic Input Validation**  
   - Detect uppercase vs lowercase input.  
   - Handle invalid input gracefully.  

5. **Advanced Input Validation**  
   - Handle numeric and multiple-letter inputs.  
   - Ask user for a number and repeat a character accordingly.

This project helped me practice:

Writing clear, commented Python code.
Using sets, loops, and conditionals effectively.
Handling user input validation safely.
Organizing solutions into modular scripts.
